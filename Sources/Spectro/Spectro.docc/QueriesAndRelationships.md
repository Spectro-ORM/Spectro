# Queries and relationships

Compose immutable queries and choose between joined reads and relationship preloading.

## Overview

### Build a query

```swift
let query = repo.query(User.self)
    .where { $0.name == "Alice" }
    .orderBy({ $0.createdAt }, .desc)

let users = try await query.limit(20).all()
let count = try await query.count()
let first = try await query.first()
```

``Query`` is a value type. Filtering, ordering, and limiting return a new query; terminal methods execute it. Use `firstOrFail()` when absence should throw, and `page(size:page:)` for a ``Page`` with items, total count, and navigation metadata. Page numbers start at one.

The query builder binds values separately from SQL text. Use the API's typed fields for filters, ordering, grouping, and aggregates.

### Declare a relationship

```swift
@Schema("users")
struct User {
    @ID var id: UUID
    @Column var name: String
    @Timestamp var createdAt: Date
    @HasMany var posts: [Post]
}

@Schema("posts")
struct Post {
    @ID var id: UUID
    @Column var title: String
    @ForeignKey var userId: UUID
    @BelongsTo var user: User?
}
```

``ForeignKey`` describes the stored key, while ``HasMany``, ``HasOne``, ``BelongsTo``, and ``ManyToMany`` describe loading relationships. Create actual foreign-key constraints and indexes through migrations.

### Preload related records

```swift
let users = try await repo.query(User.self)
    .orderBy({ $0.name }, .asc)
    .preload(\.$posts)
    .all()
```

Use the projected relationship key path, such as `\.$posts`. Preloading batches related records for the selected parents instead of issuing one query per parent. Supply `foreignKey:` when the field does not follow the naming convention. Chain preloads to load multiple relationships.

### Return typed joined models

```swift
let postsWithUsers: [(Post, User?)] = try await repo.query(Post.self)
    .leftJoinAndExecute(User.self, on: { $0.left.userId == $0.right.id })
```

Each side has its own column projection. A missing right-side row is `nil`; a present row that cannot decode throws. Typed left joins require a nonnullable primary key on the optional side to distinguish absence.

Model-returning right joins cannot represent an absent main model and throw. Reverse the query and use a left join when you need to retain all rows from the other table. Self joins and repeated tables require aliases and are not supported by typed joined execution.

Query operations also work on the repository supplied to a transaction. See <doc:TransactionsAndConfiguration>.
